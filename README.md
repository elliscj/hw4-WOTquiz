# hw4-Wheel Of Time Quiz

## Motivation

Have you ever read The Wheel of Time? if your answer was no, I have a homework assignment for you; go to your local book store or to Audible and buy them. If you have any interest in fantasy I promise you will not be disappointed. It is my favorite fantasy seiries and I love talking to people about it. I made this quiz to challenge my friends knowledge and prove that I am the ultimate Wheel of Time nerd.cle

## Future Fixes

In the future I would like to add some more functionality to the quiz including ordering the high scores list to display the ultimate champion (ME) and add more questions to further test our knowledge.
